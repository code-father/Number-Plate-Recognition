# Number-Plate-Recognition
Automatic Number Plate Recognition or ANPR is the process of recognising the characters of a number plate of a vehicle. 
The way I approached this problem is first the number plate is detected in the image. 
After that character recognition is done by using Pytesseract which is an OCR tool for python. 

Requirements:
Python <br/>
Pillow <br/>
OpenCV <br/>
Pytesseract <br/>
